<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_abstract">1.1. Abstract</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In today&#8217;s computing landscape, regular expressions are used heavily for the
purpose of specifying parsers. They are normally treated as black boxes, linked
together with program logic. User code is executed in between invocations of
the regular expression engine. To add code before a pattern terminates, the
programmer is required to break patterns and paste them back together with
program logic. The more inline code needed, the less the advantages of regular
expressions are seen.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Ragel is a software development tool that allows user code to be embedded into
the transitions of a regular expression&#8217;s corresponding state machine,
eliminating the need to switch from the regular expression engine to the user
code execution environment, and then back again. As a result, expressions can
be maximally continuous. One is free to specify an entire parser using a single
regular expression. The single-expression model affords concise and elegant
descriptions of languages and the generation of very simple, fast and robust
code. Ragel compiles executable finite state machines from a high level regular
language notation. Ragel targets C, C++, Objective-C, D, Go, GNU ASM x86-64,
Java, Ruby, C#, OCaml, Crack, Rust, Julia and JavaScript</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In addition to building state machines from regular expressions, Ragel allows
the programmer to directly specify state machines with state charts. These two
notations may be freely combined. There are also facilities for controlling
nondeterminism in the resulting machines and building scanners using patterns
that themselves have embedded actions. Ragel can produce code that is small and
runs very fast. Ragel can handle integer-sized alphabets and can compile very
large state machines.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_motivation">1.2. Motivation</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>When a programmer is faced with the task of producing a parser for a
context-free language, there are many tools to choose from. It is quite common
to generate useful and efficient parsers for programming languages from a
formal grammar. It is also quite common for programmers to avoid such tools
when making parsers for simple computer languages, such as file formats and
communication protocols.  Such languages are often regular, and tools for
processing the context-free languages are viewed as too heavyweight for the
purpose of parsing regular languages. The extra run-time effort required for
supporting the recursive nature of context-free languages is wasted.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>When we turn to the regular expression-based parsing tools, such as Lex, Re2C,
and scripting languages such as Sed, Awk and Perl we find that they are split
into two levels: a regular expression matching engine and some kind of program
logic for linking patterns together.  For example, a Lex program is composed of
sets of regular expressions. The implied program logic repeatedly attempts to
match a pattern in the current set. When a match is found, the associated user
code executed. It requires the user to consider a language as a sequence of
independent tokens. Scripting languages and regular expression libraries allow
one to link patterns together using arbitrary program code.  This is very
flexible and powerful; however, we can be more concise and clear if we avoid
gluing together regular expressions with if statements and while loops.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This model of execution, where the runtime alternates between regular
expression matching and user code execution places restrictions on when
action code may be executed. Since action code can only be associated with
complete patterns, any action code that must be executed before an entire
pattern is matched requires that the pattern be broken into smaller units.
Instead of being forced to disrupt the regular expression syntax and write
smaller expressions, it is desirable to retain a single expression and embed
code for performing actions directly into the transitions that move over the
characters. After all, capable programmers are astutely aware of the machinery
underlying their programs, so why not provide them with access to that
machinery? To achieve this, we require an action execution model for associating
code with the sub-expressions of a regular expression in a way that does not
disrupt its syntax.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The primary goal of Ragel is to provide developers with an ability to embed
actions into the transitions and states of a regular expression&#8217;s state machine
in support of the definition of entire parsers or large sections of parsers
using a single regular expression.  From the regular expression we gain a clear
and concise statement of our language. From the state machine we obtain a very
fast and robust executable that lends itself to many kinds of analysis and
visualization.</p></div>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_overview">1.3. Overview</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Ragel is a language for specifying state machines. The Ragel program is a
compiler that assembles a state machine definition to executable code.  Ragel
is based on the principle that any regular language can be converted to a
deterministic finite state automaton. Since every regular language has a state
machine representation and vice versa, the terms regular language and state
machine (or just machine) will be used interchangeably in this document.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Ragel outputs machines to C, C++, Objective-C, D, Go, GNU ASM x86-64, Java,
Ruby, C#, OCaml, Crack, Rust, Julia and JavaScript code. The output is
designed to be generic and is not bound to any particular input or processing
method. A Ragel machine expects to have data passed to it in buffer blocks.
When there is no more input, the machine can be queried for acceptance.  In
this way, a Ragel machine can be used to simply recognize a regular language
like a regular expression library. By embedding code into the regular language,
a Ragel machine can also be used to parse input.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The Ragel language has many operators for constructing and manipulating
machines. Machines are built up from smaller machines, to bigger ones, to the
final machine representing the language that needs to be recognized or parsed.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The core state machine construction operators are those found in most theory
of computation textbooks. They date back to the 1950s and are widely studied.
They are based on set operations and permit one to think of languages as a set
of strings. They are Union, Intersection, Difference, Concatenation and Kleene
Star. Put together, these operators make up what most people know as regular
expressions. Ragel also provides a scanner construction operator
and provides operators for explicitly constructing machines
using a state chart method. In the state chart method, one joins machines
together without any implied transitions and then explicitly specifies where
epsilon transitions should be drawn.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The state machine manipulation operators are specific to Ragel. They allow the
programmer to access the states and transitions of regular language&#8217;s
corresponding machine. There are two uses of the manipulation operators. The
first and primary use is to embed code into transitions and states, allowing
the programmer to specify the actions of the state machine.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Ragel attempts to make the action embedding facility as intuitive as possible.
To do so, a number of issues need to be addressed.  For example, when making a
nondeterministic specification into a DFA using machines that have embedded
actions, new transitions are often made that have the combined actions of
several source transitions. Ragel ensures that multiple actions associated with
a single transition are ordered consistently with respect to the order of
reference and the natural ordering implied by the construction operators.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The second use of the manipulation operators is to assign priorities to
transitions. Priorities provide a convenient way of controlling any
nondeterminism introduced by the construction operators. Suppose two
transitions leave from the same state and go to distinct target states on the
same character. If these transitions are assigned conflicting priorities, then
during the determinization process the transition with the higher priority will
take precedence over the transition with the lower priority. The lower priority
transition gets abandoned. The transitions would otherwise be combined into a new
transition that goes to a new state that is a combination of the original
target states. Priorities are often required for segmenting machines. The most
common uses of priorities have been encoded into a set of simple operators
that should be used instead of priority embeddings whenever possible.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>For the purposes of embedding, Ragel divides transitions and states into
different classes. There are four operators for embedding actions and
priorities into the transitions of a state machine. It is possible to embed
into entering transitions, finishing transitions, all transitions and leaving
transitions. The embedding into leaving transitions is a special case.
These transition embeddings get stored in the final states of a machine.  They
are transferred to any transitions that are made going out of the machine by
future concatenation or kleene star operations.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>There are several more operators for embedding actions into states. Like the
transition embeddings, there are various different classes of states that the
embedding operators access. For example, one can access start states, final
states or all states, among others. Unlike the transition embeddings, there are
several different types of state action embeddings. These are executed at
various different times during the processing of input. It is possible to embed
actions that are executed on transitions into a state, on transitions out of a
state, on transitions taken on the error event, or on transitions taken on the
EOF event.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Within actions, it is possible to influence the behaviour of the state machine.
The user can write action code that jumps or calls to another portion of the
machine, changes the current character being processed, or breaks out of the
processing loop. With the state machine calling feature Ragel can be used to
parse languages that are not regular. For example, one can parse balanced
parentheses by calling into a parser when an open parenthesis character is seen
and returning to the state on the top of the stack when the corresponding
closing parenthesis character is seen. More complicated context-free languages
such as expressions in C are out of the scope of Ragel.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Ragel also provides a scanner construction operator that can be used to build
scanners much the same way that Lex is used. The Ragel generated code, which
relies on user-defined variables for backtracking, repeatedly tries to match
patterns to the input, favouring longer patterns over shorter ones and patterns
that appear ahead of others when the lengths of the possible matches are
identical. When a pattern is matched the associated action is executed.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The key distinguishing feature between scanners in Ragel and scanners in Lex is
that Ragel patterns may be arbitrary Ragel expressions and can therefore
contain embedded code. With a Ragel-based scanner the user need not wait until
the end of a pattern before user code can be executed.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Scanners do take Ragel out of the domain of pure state machines and require the
user to maintain the backtracking related variables.  However, scanners
integrate well with regular state machine instantiations. They can be called to
or jumped to only when needed, or they can be called out of or jumped out of
when a simpler, pure state machine model is appropriate.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Two types of output code style are available. Ragel can produce a table-driven
machine or a directly executable machine. The directly executable machine is
much faster than the table-driven. On the other hand, the table-driven machine
is more compact and less demanding on the host language compiler. It is better
suited to compiling large state machines.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_related_work">1.4. Related Work</h3>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_lex">1.4.1. Lex</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Lex is perhaps the best-known tool for constructing parsers from regular
expressions. In the Lex processing model, generated code attempts to match one
of the user&#8217;s regular expression patterns, favouring longer matches over
shorter ones. Once a match is made it then executes the code associated with
the pattern and consumes the matching string.  This process is repeated until
the input is fully consumed.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Through the use of start conditions, related sets of patterns may be defined.
The active set may be changed at any time.  This allows the user to define
different lexical regions. It also allows the user to link patterns together by
requiring that some patterns come before others.  This is quite like a
concatenation operation. However, use of Lex for languages that require a
considerable amount of pattern concatenation is inappropriate. In such cases a
Lex program deteriorates into a manually specified state machine, where start
conditions define the states and pattern actions define the transitions.  Lex
is therefore best suited to parsing tasks where the language to be parsed can
be described in terms of regions of tokens.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Lex is useful in many scenarios and has undoubtedly stood the test of time.
There are, however, several drawbacks to using Lex.  Lex can impose too much
overhead for parsing applications where buffering is not required because all
the characters are available in a single string.  In these cases there is
structure to the language to be parsed and a parser specification tool can
help, but employing a heavyweight processing loop that imposes a stream
pull model and dynamic input buffer allocation is inappropriate.  An
example of this kind of scenario is the conversion of floating point numbers
contained in a string to their corresponding numerical values.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Another drawback is the very issue that Ragel attempts to solve.
It is not possible to execute a user action while
matching a character contained inside a pattern. For example, if scanning a
programming language and string literals can contain newlines which must be
counted, a Lex user must break up a string literal pattern so as to associate
an action with newlines. This forces the definition of a new start condition.
Alternatively the user can reprocess the text of the matched string literal to
count newlines.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_re2c">1.4.2. Re2C</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The Re2C program defines an input processing model similar to that of Lex.
Re2C focuses on making generated state machines run very fast and
integrate easily into any program, free of dependencies.  Re2C generates
directly executable code and is able to claim that generated parsers run nearly
as fast as their hand-coded equivalents.  This is very important for user
adoption, as programmers are reluctant to use a tool when a faster alternative
exists.  A consideration to ease of use is also important because developers
need the freedom to integrate the generated code as they see fit.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_regular_expression_libraries">1.4.3. Regular Expression Libraries</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Many scripting languages provide ways of composing parsers by linking regular
expressions using program logic. For example, Sed and Awk are two established
Unix scripting tools that allow the programmer to exploit regular expressions
for the purpose of locating and extracting text of interest. High-level
programming languages such as Perl, Python, PHP and Ruby all provide regular
expression libraries that allow the user to combine regular expressions with
arbitrary code.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In addition to supporting the linking of regular expressions with arbitrary
program logic, the Perl programming language permits the embedding of code into
regular expressions. Perl embeddings do not translate into the embedding of
code into deterministic state machines. Perl regular expressions are in fact
not fully compiled to deterministic machines when embedded code is involved.
They are instead interpreted and involve backtracking. This is shown by the
following Perl program. When it is fed the input <code>abcd</code> the interpreter
attempts to match the first alternative, printing <code>a1 b1</code>.  When this
possibility fails it backtracks and tries the second possibility, printing
<code>a2 b2</code>, at which point it succeeds.</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>print "YES\n" if ( &lt;STDIN&gt; =~
        /( a (?{ print "a1 "; }) b (?{ print "b1 "; }) cX ) |
         ( a (?{ print "a2 "; }) b (?{ print "b2 "; }) cd )/x )</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In Ragel there is no regular expression interpreter. Aside from the scanner
operator, all Ragel expressions are made into deterministic machines and the
run time simply moves from state to state as it consumes input. An equivalent
parser expressed in Ragel would attempt both of the alternatives concurrently,
printing <code>a1 a2 b1 b2</code>.</p></div>

<h3 id="_ragel_state_machine_specifications">2.1. Ragel State Machine Specifications</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>A Ragel input file consists of a program in the host language that contains
embedded machine specifications.  Ragel normally passes input straight to
output.  When it sees a machine specification it stops to read the Ragel
statements and possibly generate code in place of the specification. Afterwards
it continues to pass input through.  There can be any number of FSM
specifications in an input file. A multi-line FSM spec starts with <code>%%{</code> and
ends with <code>}%%</code>. A single-line FSM spec starts with <code>%%</code> and ends at the
first newline.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>While Ragel is looking for FSM specifications it does basic lexical analysis on
the surrounding input. It interprets literal strings and comments so a
<code>%%</code> sequence in either of those will not trigger the parsing of an FSM
specification. Ragel does not pass the input through any preprocessor nor does it
interpret preprocessor directives itself so includes, defines and ifdef logic
cannot be used to alter the parse of a Ragel input file. It is therefore not
possible to use an <code>#if 0</code> directive to comment out a machine as is
commonly done in C code. As an alternative, a machine can be prevented from
causing any generated output by commenting out write statements.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In the example below, a multi-line specification is used to define the machine
and single line specifications are used to trigger the writing of the machine
data and execution code. This example shows parsing of a command line argument.</p></div>

specifications persist in memory, a machine&#8217;s statements can be spread across

<h3 id="machconst">2.5. Regular Language Operators</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>When using Ragel it is helpful to have a sense of how it constructs machines.
The determinization process can produce results that seem unusual to someone
not familiar with the NFA to DFA conversion algorithm. In this section we
describe Ragel&#8217;s state machine operators. Though the operators are defined
using epsilon transitions, it should be noted that this is for discussion only.
The epsilon transitions described in this section do not persist, but are
immediately removed by the determinization process which is executed at every
operation. Ragel does not make use of any nondeterministic intermediate state
machines.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>To create an epsilon transition between two states <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> is to
copy all of the properties of <code>y</code> into <code>x</code>. This involves drawing in
all of <code>y</code>'s to-state actions, EOF actions, etc., in addition to its
transitions. If <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> both have a transition out on the same
character, then the transitions must be combined.  During transition
combination a new transition is made that goes to a new state that is the
combination of both target states. The new combination state is created using
the same epsilon transition method.  The new state has an epsilon transition
drawn to all the states that compose it. Since the creation of new epsilon
transitions may be triggered every time an epsilon transition is drawn, the
process of drawing epsilon transitions is repeated until there are no more
epsilon transitions to be made.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>A very common error that is made when using Ragel is to make machines that do
too much. That is, to create machines that have unintentional
nondeterministic properties. This usually results from being unaware of the common strings
between machines that are combined together using the regular language
operators. This can involve never leaving a machine, causing its actions to be
propagated through all the following states. Or it can involve an alternation
where both branches are unintentionally taken simultaneously.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This problem forces one to think hard about the language that needs to be
matched. To guard against this kind of problem one must ensure that the machine
specification is divided up using boundaries that do not allow ambiguities from
one portion of the machine to the next. See the chapter on
<a href="#controlling_nondeterminism">Controlling Nondeterminism</a> for more on this
problem and how to solve it.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The Graphviz tool is an immense help when debugging improperly compiled
machines or otherwise learning how to use Ragel. Graphviz Dot files can be
generated from Ragel programs using the <code>-V</code> option. See the section on
<a href="#visualization">Visualization</a> for more information.</p></div>

<pre><code>expr | expr</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The union operation produces a machine that matches any string in machine one
or machine two. The operation first creates a new start state. Epsilon
transitions are drawn from the new start state to the start states of both
input machines.  The resulting machine has a final state set equivalent to the
union of the final state sets of both input machines. In this operation, there
is the opportunity for nondeterminism among both branches. If there are
strings, or prefixes of strings that are matched by both machines then the new
machine will follow both parts of the alternation at once. The union operation is
shown below.</p></div>

machines. After the result has been made deterministic, any final state that is
not a combination of final states from both machines has its final state status
revoked. To complete the operation, paths that do not lead to a final state are
pruned from the machine. Therefore, if there are any such paths in either of
the expressions they will be removed by the intersection operator.
Intersection can be used to require that two independent patterns be
simultaneously satisfied as in the following example.</p></div>

a union is performed on the two machines. After the result has been made
deterministic, any final state that came from machine two or is a combination
of states involving a final state from machine two has its final state status
revoked. As with intersection, the operation is completed by pruning any path
that does not lead to a final state.  The following example demonstrates the
use of subtraction to exclude specific cases from a set.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Concatenation produces a machine that matches all the strings in machine one
followed by all the strings in machine two.  Concatenation draws epsilon
transitions from the final states of the first machine to the start state of
the second machine. The final states of the first machine lose their final
state status, unless the start state of the second machine is final as well.
Concatenation is the default operator. Two machines next to each other with no
operator between them results in concatenation.</p></div>
<div class="imageblock" style="text-align:left;">
<div class="content">
<img src="opconcat.png" alt="opconcat.png" />
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The opportunity for nondeterministic behaviour results from the possibility of
the final states of the first machine accepting a string that is also accepted
by the start state of the second machine.
The most common scenario in which this happens is the
concatenation of a machine that repeats some pattern with a machine that gives
a terminating string, but the repetition machine does not exclude the
terminating string. The example in <a href="#strong_difference">Strong Difference</a>
guards against this. Another example is the expression <code>("'" any* "'")</code>.
When executed the thread of control will
never leave the <code>any*</code> machine.  This is a problem especially if actions
are embedded to process the characters of the <code>any*</code> component.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In the following example, the first machine is always active due to the
nondeterministic nature of concatenation. This particular nondeterminism is intended,
however, because we wish to permit EOF strings before the end of the input.</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">

<div class="content">
<img src="exconcat.png" alt="exconcat.png" />
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>There is a language ambiguity involving concatenation and subtraction. Because
concatenation is the default operator for two adjacent machines there is an
ambiguity between subtraction of a positive numerical literal and concatenation
of a negative numerical literal. For example, <code>(x-7)</code> could be interpreted as
<code>(x . -7)</code> or <code>(x - 7)</code>. In the Ragel language, the subtraction operator always
takes precedence over concatenation of a negative literal. We adhere to the
rule that the default concatenation operator takes effect only when there are
no other operators between two machines. Beware of writing machines such as
<code>(any -1)</code> when what is desired is a concatenation of <code>any</code> and <code>-1</code>. Instead
write <code>(any . -1)</code> or <code>(any (-1))</code>. If in doubt of the meaning of your program
do not rely on the default concatenation operator; always use the <code>.</code> symbol.</p></div>

<div class="content">
<pre><code>expr*</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The machine resulting from the Kleene Star operator will match zero or more
repetitions of the machine it is applied to.
It creates a new start state and an additional final
state.  Epsilon transitions are drawn between the new start state and the old start
state, between the new start state and the new final state, and
between the final states of the machine and the new start state.  After the
machine is made deterministic, the final states get all the
transitions of the start state.</p></div>
<div class="imageblock" style="text-align:left;">
<div class="content">
<img src="opstar.png" alt="opstar.png" />
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The possibility for nondeterministic behaviour arises if the final states have
transitions on any of the same characters as the start state.  This is common
when applying kleene star to an alternation of tokens. Like the other problems
arising from nondeterministic behavior, this is discussed in more detail in the chapter on
<a href="#controlling_nondeterminism">Controlling Nondeterminism</a>. This particular
problem can also be solved using the longest-match construction discussed in the section
on <a href="#generating_scanners">Scanners</a>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In this example, there is no nondeterminism introduced by the exterior kleene
star due to the newline at the end of the regular expression. Without the
newline the exterior kleene star would be redundant and there would be
ambiguity between repeating the inner range of the regular expression and the
entire regular expression. Though it would not cause a problem in this case,
unnecessary nondeterminism in the kleene star operator often causes undesired
results for new Ragel users and must be guarded against.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>State machine minimization is the process of finding the minimal equivalent FSM accepting
the language. Minimization reduces the number of states in machines
by merging equivalent states. It does not change the behaviour of the machine
in any way. It will cause some states to be merged into one because they are
functionally equivalent. State minimization is on by default. It can be turned
off with the <code>-n</code> option.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The algorithm implemented is similar to Hopcroft&#8217;s state minimization
algorithm. Hopcroft&#8217;s algorithm assumes a finite alphabet that can be listed in
memory, whereas Ragel supports arbitrary integer alphabets that cannot be
listed in memory. Though exact analysis is very difficult, Ragel minimization
runs close to O(n * log(n)) and requires O(n) temporary storage where
$n$ is the number of states.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Ragel permits the user to embed actions into the transitions of a regular
expression&#8217;s corresponding state machine. These actions are executed when the
generated code moves over a transition.  Like the regular expression operators,
the action embedding operators are fully compositional. They take a state
machine and an action as input, embed the action and yield a new state machine
that can be used in the construction of other machines. Due to the
compositional nature of embeddings, the user has complete freedom in the
placement of actions.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>A machine&#8217;s transitions are categorized into four classes. The action embedding
operators access the transitions defined by these classes. The
<em>entering transition</em> operator <code>&gt;</code> isolates the start state, then embeds an action
into all transitions leaving it. The <em>finishing transition</em> operator
<code>@</code> embeds an action into all transitions going into a final state.  The
<em>all transition</em> operator <code>$</code> embeds an action into all transitions of
an expression. The <em>leaving transition</em> operator <code>%</code> provides access
to the yet-unmade transitions moving out of the machine via the final states.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The action statement defines a block of code that can be embedded into an FSM.
Action names can be referenced by the action embedding operators in
expressions. Though actions need not be named in this way (literal blocks
of code can be embedded directly when building machines), defining reusable
blocks of code whenever possible is good practice because it potentially increases the
degree to which the machine can be minimized.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Within an action some Ragel expressions and statements are parsed and
translated. These allow the user to interact with the machine from action code.

then the action is also embedded into the start state as a leaving action. This
means that if a machine accepts the zero-length string and control passes
through the start state then the entering action is executed. Note
that this can happen on both a following character and on the EOF event.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In some machines, the start state has transtions coming in from within the
machine. In these cases the start state is first isolated from the rest of the
machine ensuring that the entering actions are executed once only.</p></div>

<h3 id="_state_action_embedding_operators">3.2. State Action Embedding Operators</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The state embedding operators allow one to embed actions into states. Like the
transition embedding operators, there are several different classes of states
that the operators access. The meanings of the symbols are similar to the
meanings of the symbols used for the transition embedding operators. The design
of the state selections was driven by a need to cover the states of an
expression with exactly one error action.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Unlike the transition embedding operators, the state embedding operators are
also distinguished by the different kinds of events that embedded actions can
be associated with. Therefore the state embedding operators have two
components.  The first, which is the first one or two characters, specifies the
class of states that the action will be embedded into. The second component
specifies the type of event the action will be executed on. The symbols of the
second component also have equivalent keywords.</p></div>

also be desirable to consume input in an attempt to return the input stream to
some known state and resume parsing. To support error handling and recovery,
Ragel provides error action embedding operators. There are two kinds of error
actions: global error actions and local error actions. Error actions can be
used to simply report errors, or by jumping to a machine instantiation that
consumes input, can attempt to recover from errors.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Like global error actions, local error actions are also stored in the states
they are embedded into until a transfer point. The transfer point is different
however. Each local error action embedding is associated with a name. When a
machine definition has been fully constructed, all local error action
embeddings associated with the same name as the machine definition are
transferred to the error transitions. At this time they are also embedded as
EOF actions in the case of non-final states.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Local error actions can be used to specify an action to take when a particular
section of a larger state machine fails to match. A particular machine
definition&#8217;s &#8220;thread&#8221; may die and the local error actions executed, however
the machine as a whole may continue to match input.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>There are two forms of local error action embeddings. In the first form the
name defaults to the current machine. In the second form the machine name can
be specified.  This is useful when it is more convenient to specify the local
error action in a sub-definition that is used to construct the machine
definition that the local error action is associated with. To embed local error
actions and explicitly state the machine definition on which the transfer is to
happen use <code>(name, action)</code> as the action.</p></div>

<h3 id="_action_ordering_and_duplicates">3.3. Action Ordering and Duplicates</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>When combining expressions that have embedded actions it is often the case that
a number of actions must be executed on a single input character. For example,
following a concatenation the leaving action of the left expression and the
entering action of the right expression will be embedded into one transition.
This requires a method of ordering actions that is intuitive and
predictable for the user, and repeatable for the compiler.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>We associate with the embedding of each action a unique timestamp that is
used to order actions that appear together on a single transition in the final
state machine. To accomplish this, we recursively traverse the parse tree of
regular expressions and assign timestamps to action embeddings. References to
machine definitions are followed in the traversal. When we visit a
parse tree node, we assign timestamps to all <em>entering</em> action embeddings,
recurse on the parse tree, then assign timestamps to the remaining <em>all</em>,
<em>finishing</em>, and <em>leaving</em> embeddings in the order in which they
appear.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>By default Ragel does not permit a single action to appear multiple times in an action
list. When the final machine has been created, actions that appear more than
once in a single transition, to-state, from-state or EOF action list have their
duplicates removed.
The first appearance of the action is preserved. This is useful in a number of
scenarios. First, it allows us to union machines with common prefixes without
worrying about the action embeddings in the prefix being duplicated. Second, it
prevents leaving actions from being transferred multiple times. This can
happen when a machine is repeated, then followed with another machine that
begins with a common character. For example:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>word = [a-z]+ %act;
main := word ( '\n' word )* '\n\n';</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Note that Ragel does not compare action bodies to determine if they have
identical program text. It simply checks for duplicates using each action
block&#8217;s unique location in the program.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The removal of duplicates can be turned off using the <code>-d</code> option.</p></div>

once in the set of actions executed on a character.  Multiple calls may result
in backing up over the beginning of the buffer block. The <code>fhold</code>

be used anywhere, <code>fexec</code> requires the user to ensure that the target of the
backtrack is in the current buffer block or is known to be somewhere ahead of
it. The machine will continue iterating forward until <code>pe</code> is arrived at,
<code>fbreak</code> is called or the machine moves into the error state. In actions
embedded into transitions, the <code>fexec</code> statement is equivalent to setting <code>p</code>
to one position ahead of the next character to process.  If the user also
modifies <code>pe</code>, it is possible to change the buffer block entirely.

<div class="paragraph"><p>Once actions with control-flow commands are embedded into a
machine, the user must exercise caution when using the machine as the operand
to other machine construction operators. If an action jumps to another state
then unioning any transition that executes that action with another transition
that follows some other path will cause that other path to be lost. Using
commands that manually jump around a machine takes us out of the domain of
regular languages because transitions that the
machine construction operators are not aware of are introduced.  These
commands should therefore be used with caution.</p></div>

<h2 id="controlling_nondeterminism">4. Controlling Nondeterminism</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>Along with the flexibility of arbitrary action embeddings comes a need to
control nondeterminism in regular expressions. If a regular expression is
ambiguous, then sub-components of a parser other than the intended parts may become
active. This means that actions that are irrelevant to the
current subset of the parser may be executed, causing problems for the
programmer.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Tools that are based on regular expression engines and that are used for
recognition tasks will usually function as intended regardless of the presence
of ambiguities. It is quite common for users of scripting languages to write
regular expressions that are heavily ambiguous and it generally does not
matter. As long as one of the potential matches is recognized, there can be any
number of other matches present.  In some parsing systems the run-time engine
can employ a strategy for resolving ambiguities, for example always pursuing
the longest possible match and discarding others.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In Ragel, there is no regular expression run-time engine, just a simple state
machine execution model. When we begin to embed actions and face the
possibility of spurious action execution, it becomes clear that controlling
nondeterminism at the machine construction level is very important. Consider
the following example.</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>ws = [\n\t ];
line = word $first ( ws word $tail )* '\n';
lines = line*;</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="imageblock" style="text-align:left;">
<div class="content">
<img src="lines1.png" alt="lines1.png" />
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Since the <code>ws</code> expression includes the newline character, we will
not finish the <code>line</code> expression when a newline character is seen. We will
simultaneously pursue the possibility of matching further words on the same
line and the possibility of matching a second line. Evidence of this fact is
in the state tables. On several transitions both the <code>first</code> and
<code>tail</code> actions are executed.  The solution here is simple: exclude
the newline character from the <code>ws</code> expression.</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>ws = [\t ];
line = word $first ( ws word $tail )* '\n';
lines = line*;</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="imageblock" style="text-align:left;">
<div class="content">
<img src="lines2.png" alt="lines2.png" />
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Solving this kind of problem is straightforward when the ambiguity is created
by strings that are a single character long.  When the ambiguity is created by
strings that are multiple characters long we have a more difficult problem. The
following example is an incorrect attempt at a regular expression for C
language comments.</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>comment = '/*' ( any @comm )* '*/';
main := comment ' ';</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="imageblock" style="text-align:left;">
<div class="content">
<img src="comments1.png" alt="comments1.png" />
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Using standard concatenation, we will never leave the <code>any*</code> expression.
We will forever entertain the possibility that a <code>'*/'</code> string that we see
is contained in a longer comment and that, simultaneously, the comment has
ended.  The concatenation of the <code>comment</code> machine with <code>SP</code> is done
to show this. When we match space, we are also still matching the comment body.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>One way to approach the problem is to exclude the terminating string from the
<code>any*</code> expression using set difference. We must be careful to exclude not just
the terminating string, but any string that contains it as a substring. A
verbose, but proper specification of a C comment parser is given by the
following regular expression.</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>comment = '/*' ( ( any @comm )* - ( any* '*/' any* ) ) '*/';</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="imageblock" style="text-align:left;">
<div class="content">
<img src="comments2.png" alt="comments2.png" />
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Note that Ragel&#8217;s strong subtraction operator <code>--</code> can also be used here.
In doing this subtraction we have phrased the problem of controlling
non-determinism in terms of excluding strings common to two expressions that
interact when combined. We can also phrase the problem in terms of the
transitions of the state machines that implement these expressions. During the
concatenation of <code>any*</code> and <code>'*/'</code> we will be making transitions that are
composed of both the loop of the first expression and the final character of
the second. At this time we want the transition on the <code>'/'</code> character to take
precedence over and disallow the transition that originated in the <code>any*</code> loop.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In another parsing problem, we wish to implement a lightweight tokenizer that
we can utilize in the composition of a larger machine. For example, some HTTP
headers have a token stream as a sub-language. The following example is an
attempt at a regular expression-based tokenizer that does not function
correctly due to unintended nondeterminism.</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>header_contents = (
    lower+ &gt;start_str $on_char %finish_str |
    ' '
)*;</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="imageblock" style="text-align:left;">
<div class="content">
<img src="smallscanner.png" alt="smallscanner.png" />
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In this case, the problem with using a standard kleene star operation is that
there is an ambiguity between extending a token and wrapping around the machine
to begin a new token. Using the standard operator, we get an undesirable
nondeterministic behaviour. Evidence of this can be seen on the transition out
of state one, back to itself.  The transition extends the string, and
simultaneously, finishes the string only to immediately begin a new one.  What
is required is for the transitions that represent an extension of a token to
take precedence over the transitions that represent the beginning of a new
token. For this problem there is no simple solution that uses standard regular
expression operators.</p></div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_priorities">4.1. Priorities</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>A priority mechanism was devised and built into the determinization process,
specifically for the purpose of allowing the user to control nondeterminism.
Priorities are integer values embedded into transitions. When the
determinization process is combining transitions that have different
priorities, the transition with the higher priority is preserved and the
transition with the lower priority is dropped.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Unfortunately, priorities can have unintended side effects because their
operation requires that they linger in transitions indefinitely. They must
linger because the Ragel program cannot know when the user is finished with a
priority embedding.  A solution whereby they are explicitly deleted after use
is conceivable; however this is not very user-friendly.  Priorities were
therefore made into named entities. Only priorities with the same name are
allowed to interact.  This allows any number of priorities to coexist in one
machine for the purpose of controlling various different regular expression
operations and eliminates the need to ever delete them. Such a scheme allows
the user to choose a unique name, embed two different priority values using
that name and be confident that the priority embedding will be free of any side
effects.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In the first form of priority embedding, the name defaults to the name of the
machine definition that the priority is assigned in. In this sense priorities
are by default local to the current machine definition or instantiation. Beware
of using this form in a longest-match machine, since there is only one name for
the entire set of longest match patterns. In the second form the priority&#8217;s
name can be specified, allowing priority interaction across machine definition
boundaries.</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
<code>expr &gt; int</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Sets starting transitions to have priority int.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<code>expr @ int</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Sets transitions that go into a final state to have priority int.

have priority int. When a transition is made going out of the machine (either
by concatenation or kleene star) its priority is immediately set to the leaving
priority.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The second form of priority assignment allows the programmer to specify the
name to which the priority is assigned.</p></div>

<h3 id="_guarded_operators_that_encapsulate_priorities">4.2. Guarded Operators that Encapsulate Priorities</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Priority embeddings are a very expressive mechanism. At the same time they
can be very confusing for the user. They force the user to imagine
the transitions inside two interacting expressions and work out the precise
effects of the operations between them. When we consider
that this problem is worsened by the
potential for side effects caused by unintended priority name collisions, we
see that exposing the user to priorities is undesirable.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Fortunately, in practice the use of priorities has been necessary only in a
small number of scenarios.  This allows us to encapsulate their functionality
into a small set of operators and fully hide them from the user. This is
advantageous from a language design point of view because it greatly simplifies
the design.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Going back to the C comment example, we can now properly specify it using a
guarded concatenation operator which we call <em>finish-guarded concatenation</em>.
From the user&#8217;s point of view, this operator terminates the first machine when
the second machine moves into a final state.  It chooses a unique name and uses
it to embed a low priority into all transitions of the first machine. A higher
priority is then embedded into the transitions of the second machine that enter
into a final state. The following example yields a machine identical to the
example in the section on <a href="#controlling_nondeterminism">Controlling Nondeterminism</a>.</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>comment = '/*' ( any @comm )* :&gt;&gt; '*/';</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="imageblock" style="text-align:left;">
<div class="content">
<img src="comments2.png" alt="comments2.png" />
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Another guarded operator is <em>left-guarded concatenation</em>, given by the
<code>&lt;:</code> compound symbol. This operator places a higher priority on all
transitions of the first machine. This is useful if one must forcibly separate
two lists that contain common elements. For example, one may need to tokenize a
stream, but first consume leading whitespace.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Ragel also includes a <em>longest-match kleene star</em> operator, given by the <code>**</code>
compound symbol. This guarded operator embeds a high priority into all
transitions of the machine. A lower priority is then embedded into the leaving
transitions.  When the kleene star operator makes the epsilon transitions from
the final states into the new start state, the lower priority will be
transferred to the epsilon transitions. In cases where following an epsilon
transition out of a final state conflicts with an existing transition out of a
final state, the epsilon transition will be dropped.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Other guarded operators are conceivable, such as guards on union that cause one
alternative to take precedence over another. These may be implemented when it
is clear they constitute a frequently used operation. In the next section we
discuss the explicit specification of state machines using state charts.</p></div>

priority to all transitions
of the first machine and a high priority to the starting transitions of the
second machine. This operator is useful if from the final states of the first
machine it is possible to accept the characters in the entering transitions of
the second machine. This operator effectively terminates the first machine
immediately upon starting the second machine, where otherwise they would be
pursued concurrently. In the following example, entry-guarded concatenation is
used to move out of a machine that matches everything at the first sign of an
end-of-input marker.</p></div>

machine only when the second accepts. In the following example, finish-guarded
concatenation causes the move out of the machine that matches everything to be

stream. These can live in any scope. Control of the input processing loop is
also possible: the user may break out of the processing loop and return to it

<div class="paragraph"><p>In the case of the C, D, Go and OCaml host languages, Ragel is able to generate very

across invocations of the machine when the data is broken into blocks that are
processed independently. This variable may be modified from outside the
execution loop, but not from within.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<code>p</code> - Data pointer. In C/C<code>/D code this variable is expected to be a
pointer to the character data to process. It should be initialized to the
beginning of the data block on every run of the machine. In C</code> it is possible
to use an object for the data pointers. The object should support comparison,
dereferencing, and pre/post increment/decrement operations. In Go, Java, Ruby
and OCaml it is used as an offset to <code>data</code> and must be an integer. In this
case it should be initialized to zero on every run of the machine.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<code>pe</code> - Data end pointer. This should be initialized to <code>p</code> plus
the data length on every run of the machine. In C++ this can be defined as one
increment operation past the last valid value. Or in the case of a zero-length
input buffer the initial value of <code>p</code>. A In Go, Java, Ruby and OCaml code this
should be initialized to the data length.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<code>eof</code> - End of file pointer. This should be set to <code>pe</code> when
the buffer block being processed is the last one, otherwise it should be set to
null. In Go, Java, Ruby and OCaml code <code>-1</code> must be used instead of null. If the EOF
event can be known only after the final buffer block has been processed, then
it is possible to set <code>p = pe = eof</code> and run the execute block.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<code>data</code> - This variable is only required in Go, Java, Ruby and OCaml code. It
must be an array containing the data to process.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<code>stack</code> - This must be an array of integers. It is used to store
integer values representing states. If the stack must resize dynamically the
<a href="#prepush">Pre-push</a> and <a href="#postpop">Post-Pop</a> statements can be used to do
this.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<code>top</code> - This must be an integer value and will be used as an offset
to <code>stack</code>, giving the next available spot on the top of the stack.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<code>act</code> - This must be an integer value. It is a variable sometimes
used by scanner code to keep track of the most recent successful pattern match.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<code>ts</code> - This must be a pointer to character data. In Go, Java, Ruby and
OCaml code this must be an integer. See <a href="#generating_scanners">Generating Scanners</a> for more information.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<code>te</code> - Also a pointer to character data.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<code>nfa_bp</code> - NFA backtrack points. Only necessary if NFA features are used.
This var must be an array of records containing at least a state and alphtype
pointer.

There are seven
components that can be generated by a write statement. These components make up the
state machine&#8217;s data, initialization code, execution code, and export definitions.
A write statement may appear before a machine is fully defined.
This allows one to write out the data first then later define the machine where

<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>write data [options];</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The write data statement causes Ragel to emit the constant static data needed
by the machine. In table-driven output styles (see
<a href="#genout">Generated Output Style</a>) this is a collection of arrays that
represent the states and transitions of the machine.  In goto-driven machines
much less data is emitted. At the very minimum a start state <code>name_start</code>
is generated.  All variables written out in machine data have both the
<code>static</code> and <code>const</code> properties and are prefixed with the name of the
machine and an underscore. The data can be placed inside a class, inside a
function, or it can be defined as global data.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Two variables are written that may be used to test the state of the machine
after a buffer block has been processed. The <code>name_error</code> variable gives
the id of the state that the machine moves into when it cannot find a valid
transition to take. The machine immediately breaks out of the processing loop when
it finds itself in the error state. The error variable can be compared to the
current state to determine if the machine has failed to parse the input. If the
machine is complete, that is from every state there is a transition to a proper
state on every possible character of the alphabet, then no error state is required
and this variable will be set to -1.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The <code>name_first_final</code> variable stores the id of the first final state.
All of the machine&#8217;s states are sorted by their final state status before
having their ids assigned. Checking if the machine has accepted its input can
then be done by checking if the current state is greater-than or equal to the
first final state.</p></div>

current state to the start state. If other variables are needed by the
generated code, such as call stack variables or scanner management
variables, they are also initialized here.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The <code>nocs</code> option to the write init statement will cause ragel to skip

<div class="paragraph"><p>The write exec statement causes Ragel to emit the state machine&#8217;s execution
code. Ragel expects several variables to be available to this code. At a very
minimum, the generated code needs access to the current character position <code>p</code>,
the ending position <code>pe</code> and the current state <code>cs</code> (though <code>pe</code> can be omitted
using the <code>noend</code> write option). The <code>p</code> variable is the cursor that the
execute code will used to traverse the input. The <code>pe</code> variable should be set
up to point to one position past the last valid character in the buffer.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Other variables are needed when certain features are used. For example using
the <code>fcall</code> or <code>fret</code> statements requires <code>stack</code> and <code>top</code> variables to be
defined. If a longest-match construction is used, variables for managing
backtracking are required.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The write exec statement has one option. The <code>noend</code> option tells Ragel to
generate code that ignores the end position <code>pe</code>. In this case the user must
explicitly break out of the processing loop using <code>fbreak</code>, otherwise the
machine will continue to process characters until it moves into the error
state. This option is useful if one wishes to process a null terminated string.
Rather than traverse the string to discover then length before processing the
input, the user can break out when the null character is seen.  The

<h3 id="_maintaining_pointers_to_input_data">5.9. Maintaining Pointers to Input Data</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In the creation of any parser it is not uncommon to require the collection of
the data being parsed.  It is always possible to collect data into a growable
buffer as the machine moves over it, however the copying of data is a somewhat
wasteful use of processor cycles. The most efficient way to collect data from
the parser is to set pointers into the input then later reference them.  This
poses a problem for uses of Ragel where the input data arrives in blocks, such
as over a socket or from a file. If a pointer is set in one buffer block but
must be used while parsing a following buffer block, some extra consideration
to correctness must be made.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The scanner constructions exhibit this problem, requiring the maintenance code
described in <a href="#generating_scanners">Generating Scanners</a>. If a longest-match
construction has been used somewhere in the machine then it is possible to take
advantage of the required prefix maintenance code in the driver program to
ensure pointers to the input are always valid. If laying down a pointer one can
set <code>ts</code> at the same spot or ahead of it. When data is shifted in between loops
the user must also shift the pointer.  In this way it is possible to maintain
pointers to the input that will always be consistent.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In general, there are two approaches for guaranteeing the consistency of
pointers to input data. The first approach is the one just described; lay down
a marker from an action, then later ensure that the data the marker points to
is preserved ahead of the buffer on the next execute invocation. This approach
is good because it allows the parser to decide on the pointer-use boundaries,
which can be arbitrarily complex parsing conditions. A downside is that it
requires any pointers that are set to be corrected in between execute
invocations.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The alternative is to find the pointer-use boundaries before invoking the execute
routine, then pass in the data using these boundaries. For example, if the
program must perform line-oriented processing, the user can scan backwards from
the end of an input block that has just been read in and process only up to the
first found newline. On the next input read, the new data is placed after the
partially read line and processing continues from the beginning of the line.
An example of line-oriented processing is given below.</p></div>

<h3 id="genout">5.11. Choosing a Generated Code Style</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>There are three styles of code output to choose from. Code style affects the
size and speed of the compiled binary. Changing code style does not require any
change to the Ragel program. There are two table-driven formats and a goto
driven format.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In addition to choosing a style to emit, there are various levels of action
code reuse to choose from.  The maximum reuse levels (<code>-T0</code>, <code>-F0</code>
and <code>-G0</code>) ensure that no FSM action code is ever duplicated by encoding
each transition&#8217;s action list as static data and iterating
through the lists on every transition. This will normally result in a smaller
binary. The less action reuse options (<code>-T1</code>, <code>-F1</code> and <code>-G1</code>)
will usually produce faster running code by expanding each transition&#8217;s action
list into a single block of code, eliminating the need to iterate through the
lists. This duplicates action code instead of generating the logic necessary
for reuse. Consequently the binary will be larger. However, this tradeoff applies to
machines with moderate to dense action lists only. If a machine&#8217;s transitions
frequently have less than two actions then the less reuse options will actually
produce both a smaller and a faster running binary due to less action sharing
overhead. The best way to choose the appropriate code style for your
application is to perform your own tests.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The table-driven FSM represents the state machine as constant static data. There are
tables of states, transitions, indices and actions. The current state is
stored in a variable. The execution is simply a loop that looks up the current
state, looks up the transition to take, executes any actions and moves to the
target state. In general, the table-driven FSM can handle any machine, produces
a smaller binary and requires a less expensive host language compile, but
results in slower running code.  Since the table-driven format is the most
flexible it is the default code style.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The flat table-driven machine is a table-based machine that is optimized for
small alphabets. Where the regular table machine uses the current character as
the key in a binary search for the transition to take, the flat table machine
uses the current character as an index into an array of transitions. This is
faster in general, however is only suitable if the span of possible characters
is small.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The goto-driven FSM represents the state machine using goto and switch
statements. The execution is a flat code block where the transition to take is
computed using switch statements and directly executable binary searches.  In
general, the goto FSM produces faster code but results in a larger binary and a
more expensive host language compile.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The goto-driven format has an additional action reuse level (<code>-G2</code>) that writes
actions directly into the state transitioning logic rather than putting all the
actions together into a single switch. Generally this produces faster running
code because it allows the machine to encode the current state using the
processor&#8217;s instruction pointer. Again, sparse machines may actually compile to
smaller binaries when <code>-G2</code> is used due to less state and action management
overhead. For many parsing applications <code>-G2</code> is the preferred output format.</p></div>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="modularization">6.1. Parser Modularization</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>It is possible to use Ragel&#8217;s machine construction and action embedding
operators to specify an entire parser using a single regular expression. In
many cases this is the desired way to specify a parser in Ragel. However, in
some scenarios the language to parse may be so large that it is difficult to
think about it as a single regular expression. It may also shift between distinct
parsing strategies, in which case modularization into several coherent blocks
of the language may be appropriate.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>It may also be the case that patterns that compile to a large number of states
must be used in a number of different contexts and referencing them in each
context results in a very large state machine. In this case, an ability to reuse
parsers would reduce code size.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>To address this, distinct regular expressions may be instantiated and linked
together by means of a jumping and calling mechanism. This mechanism is
analogous to the jumping to and calling of processor instructions. A jump
command, given in action code, causes control to be immediately passed to
another portion of the machine by way of setting the current state variable. A
call command causes the target state of the current transition to be pushed to
a state stack before control is transferred.  Later on, the original location
may be returned to with a return statement. In the following example, distinct
state machines are used to handle the parsing of two types of headers.</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>action return { fret; }
action call_date { fcall date; }
action call_name { fcall name; }

# A parser for date strings.
date := [0-9][0-9] '/'
        [0-9][0-9] '/'
        [0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9] '\n' @return;

# A parser for name strings.
name := ( [a-zA-Z]+ | ' ' )** '\n' @return;

# The main parser.
headers =
    ( 'from' | 'to' ) ':' @call_name |
    ( 'departed' | 'arrived' ) ':' @call_date;

main := headers*;</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Calling and jumping should be used carefully as they are operations that take
one out of the domain of regular languages. A machine that contains a call or
jump statement in one of its actions should be used as an argument to a machine
construction operator only with considerable care. Since DFA transitions may
actually represent several NFA transitions, a call or jump embedded in one
machine can inadvertently terminate another machine that it shares prefixes
with. Despite this danger, theses statements have proven useful for tying
together sub-parsers of a language into a parser for the full language,
especially for the purpose of modularizing code and reducing the number of
states when the machine contains frequently recurring patterns.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The section on <a href="#vals">Embedded Values and Statements</a> describes the jump and
call statements that are used to transfer control. These statements make use of
two variables that must be declared by the user, <code>stack</code> and <code>top</code>. The <code>stack</code>
variable must be an array of integers and <code>top</code> must be a single integer, which
will point to the next available space in <code>stack</code>. The <a href="#prepush">Pre-Push</a>
and <a href="#postpop">Post-Pop</a> statements which can be used to implement a
dynamically resizable array.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="labels">6.2. Referencing Names</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This section describes how to reference names in epsilon transitions
(<a href="#state_charts">State Charts</a>) and action-based control-flow statements such
as <code>fgoto</code>. There is a hierarchy of names implied in a Ragel specification.  At
the top level are the machine instantiations. Beneath the instantiations are
labels and references to machine definitions. Beneath those are more labels and
references to definitions, and so on.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Any name reference may contain multiple components separated with the <code>::</code>
compound symbol.  The search for the first component of a name reference is
rooted at the join expression that the epsilon transition or action embedding
is contained in. If the name reference is not contained in a join,
the search is rooted at the machine definition that the epsilon transition or
action embedding is contained in. Each component after the first is searched
for beginning at the location in the name tree that the previous reference
component refers to.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In the case of action-based references, if the action is embedded more than
once, the local search is performed for each embedding and the result is the
union of all the searches. If no result is found for action-based references then
the search is repeated at the root of the name tree.  Any action-based name
search may be forced into a strictly global search by prefixing the name
reference with <code>::</code>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The final component of the name reference must resolve to a unique entry point.
If a name is unique in the entire name tree it can be referenced as is. If it
is not unique it can be specified by qualifying it with names above it in the
name tree. However, it can always be renamed.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="generating_scanners">6.3. Scanners</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Scanners are very much intertwined with regular-languages and their
corresponding processors. For this reason Ragel supports the definition of
scanners.  The generated code will repeatedly attempt to match patterns from a
list, favouring longer patterns over shorter patterns.  In the case of
equal-length matches, the generated code will favour patterns that appear ahead
of others. When a scanner makes a match it executes the user code associated
with the match, consumes the input then resumes scanning.</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>&lt;machine_name&gt; := |*
        pattern1 =&gt; action1;
        pattern2 =&gt; action2;
        ...
    *|;</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>On the surface, Ragel scanners are similar to those defined by Lex. Though
there is a key distinguishing feature: patterns may be arbitrary Ragel
expressions and can therefore contain embedded code. With a Ragel-based scanner
the user need not wait until the end of a pattern before user code can be
executed.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Scanners can be used to process sub-languages, as well as for tokenizing
programming languages. In the following example a scanner is used to tokenize
the contents of a header field.</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>word = [a-z]+;
head_name = 'Header';

header := |*
    word;
    ' ';
    '\n' =&gt; { fret; };
*|;

main := ( head_name ':' @{ fcall header; } )*;</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The scanner construction has a purpose similar to the longest-match kleene star
operator <code>**</code>. The key
difference is that a scanner is able to backtrack to match a previously matched
shorter string when the pursuit of a longer string fails.  For this reason the
scanner construction operator is not a pure state machine construction
operator. It relies on several variables that enable it to backtrack and make
pointers to the matched input text available to the user.  For this reason
scanners must be immediately instantiated. They cannot be defined inline or
referenced by another expression. Scanners must be jumped to or called.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Scanners rely on the <code>ts</code>, <code>te</code> and <code>act</code> variables to be present so that they
can backtrack and make pointers to the matched text available to the user. If
input is processed using multiple calls to the execute code then the user must
ensure that when a token is only partially matched that the prefix is preserved
on the subsequent invocation of the execute code.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The <code>ts</code> variable must be defined as a pointer to the input data.
It is used for recording where the current token match begins. This variable
may be used in action code for retrieving the text of the current match.  Ragel
ensures that in between tokens and outside of the longest-match machines that
this pointer is set to null. In between calls to the execute code the user must
check if <code>ts</code> is set and if so, ensure that the data it points to is
preserved ahead of the next buffer block. This is described in more detail
below.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The <code>te</code> variable must also be defined as a pointer to the input data.
It is used for recording where a match ends and where scanning of the next
token should begin. This can also be used in action code for retrieving the
text of the current match.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The <code>act</code> variable must be defined as an integer type. It is used for recording
the identity of the last pattern matched when the scanner must go past a
matched pattern in an attempt to make a longer match. If the longer match fails
it may need to consult the <code>act</code> variable. In some cases, use of the <code>act</code>
variable can be avoided because the value of the current state is enough
information to determine which token to accept, however in other cases this is
not enough and so the <code>act</code> variable is used.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>When the longest-match operator is in use, the user&#8217;s driver code must take on
some buffer management functions. The following algorithm gives an overview of
the steps that should be taken to properly use the longest-match operator.</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Read a block of input data.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Run the execute code.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
If <code>ts</code> is set, the execute code will expect the incomplete
token to be preserved ahead of the buffer on the next invocation of the execute
code.
</p>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Shift the data beginning at <code>ts</code> and ending at <code>pe</code> to the
beginning of the input buffer.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Reset <code>ts</code> to the beginning of the buffer.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Shift <code>te</code> by the distance from the old value of <code>ts</code>
to the new value. The <code>te</code> variable may or may not be valid.  There is
no way to know if it holds a meaningful value because it is not kept at null
when it is not in use. It can be shifted regardless.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Read another block of data into the buffer, immediately following any
preserved data.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Run the scanner on the new data.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The following listing shows the required handling of an input stream in which a
token is broken by the input block boundaries. After processing up to and
including the &#8220;t&#8221; of &#8220;characters&#8221;, the prefix of the string token must be
retained and processing should resume at the &#8220;e&#8221; on the next iteration of the
execute code.</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>      a)           A stream "of characters" to be scanned.

                   ts         p        pe</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If one uses a large input buffer for collecting input then the number of times
the shifting must be done will be small. Furthermore, if one takes care not to
define tokens that are allowed to be very long and instead processes these
items using pure state machines or sub-scanners, then only a small amount of
data will ever need to be shifted.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Following an invocation of the execute code there may be a partially matched
token (a). The data of the partially matched token must be preserved ahead of
the new data on the next invocation (b).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Since scanners attempt to make the longest possible match of input, patterns
such as identifiers require one character of lookahead in order to trigger a
match. In the case of the last token in the input stream the user must ensure
that the <code>eof</code> variable is set so that the final token is flushed out.</p></div>

<h3 id="state_charts">6.4. State Charts</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In addition to supporting the construction of state machines using regular
languages, Ragel provides a way to manually specify state machines using
state charts.  The comma operator combines machines together without any
implied transitions. The user can then manually link machines by specifying
epsilon transitions with the <code>-&gt;</code> operator.  Epsilon transitions are drawn
between the final states of a machine and entry points defined by labels.  This
makes it possible to build machines using the explicit state-chart method while
making minimal changes to the Ragel language.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>An interesting feature of Ragel&#8217;s state chart construction method is that it
can be mixed freely with regular expression constructions. A state chart may be
referenced from within a regular expression, or a regular expression may be
used in the definition of a state chart transition.</p></div>

</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_simplifying_state_charts">6.4.4. Simplifying State Charts</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>There are two benefits to providing state charts in Ragel. The first is that it
allows us to take a state chart with a full listing of states and transitions
and simplify it in selective places using regular expressions.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The state chart method of specifying parsers is very common.  It is an
effective programming technique for producing robust code. The key disadvantage
becomes clear when one attempts to comprehend a large parser specified in this
way.  These programs usually require many lines, causing logic to be spread out
over large distances in the source file. Remembering the function of a large
number of states can be difficult and organizing the parser in a sensible way
requires discipline because branches and repetition present many file layout
options.  This kind of programming takes a specification with inherent
structure such as looping, alternation and concatenation and expresses it in a
flat form.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If we could take an isolated component of a manually programmed state chart,
that is, a subset of states that has only one entry point, and implement it
using regular language operators then we could eliminate all the explicit
naming of the states contained in it. By eliminating explicitly named states
and replacing them with higher-level specifications we simplify a state machine
specification.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>For example, sometimes chains of states are needed, with only a small number of
possible characters appearing along the chain. These can easily be replaced
with a concatenation of characters. Sometimes a group of common states
implement a loop back to another single portion of the machine. Rather than
manually duplicate all the transitions that loop back, we may be able to
express the loop using a kleene star operator.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Ragel allows one to take this state map simplification approach. We can build
state machines using a state map model and implement portions of the state map
using regular languages. In place of any transition in the state machine,
entire sub-machines can be given. These can encapsulate functionality
defined elsewhere. An important aspect of the Ragel approach is that when we
wrap up a collection of states using a regular expression we do not lose
access to the states and transitions. We can still execute code on the
transitions that we have encapsulated.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="down">6.4.5. Dropping Down One Level of Abstraction</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The second benefit of incorporating state charts into Ragel is that it permits
us to bypass the regular language abstraction if we need to. Ragel&#8217;s action
embedding operators are sometimes insufficient for expressing certain parsing
tasks.  In the same way that is useful for C language programmers to drop down
to assembly language programming using embedded assembler, it is sometimes
useful for the Ragel programmer to drop down to programming with state charts.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In the following example, we wish to buffer the characters of an XML CDATA
sequence. The sequence is terminated by the string <code>]]&gt;</code>. The challenge
in our application is that we do not wish the terminating characters to be
buffered. An expression of the form <code>any* @buffer :&gt;&gt; ']]&gt;'</code> will not work
because the buffer will always contain the characters <code>]]</code> on the end.
Instead, what we need is to delay the buffering of <code>]</code>
characters until a time when we
abandon the terminating sequence and go back into the main loop. There is no
easy way to express this using Ragel&#8217;s regular expression and action embedding
operators, and so an ability to drop down to the state chart method is useful.</p></div>

<h3 id="semantic">6.5. Semantic Conditions</h3>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_semantic_conditions">6.5.1. Semantic Conditions</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Many communication protocols contain variable-length fields, where the length
of the field is given ahead of the field as a value. This
problem cannot be expressed using regular languages because of its
context-dependent nature. The prevalence of variable-length fields in
communication protocols motivated us to introduce semantic conditions into
the Ragel language.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>A semantic condition is a block of user code that is interpreted as an
expression and evaluated immediately
before a transition is taken. If the code returns a value of true, the
transition may be taken.  We can now embed code that extracts the length of a
field, then proceed to match $n$ data values.</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>action rec_num { i = 0; n = getnumber(); }

<div class="content">
<img src="conds1.png" alt="conds1.png" />
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The Ragel implementation of semantic conditions does not force us to give up the
compositional property of Ragel definitions. For example, a machine that tests
the length of a field using conditions can be unioned with another machine
that accepts some of the same strings, without the two machines interfering with
one another. The user need not be concerned about whether or not the result of the
semantic condition will affect the matching of the second machine.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>To see this, first consider that when a user associates a condition with an
existing transition, the transition&#8217;s label is translated from the base character
to its corresponding value in the space that represents &#8220;condition $c$ true&#8221;. Should
the determinization process combine a state that has a conditional transition
with another state that has a transition on the same input character but
without a condition, then the condition-less transition first has its label
translated into two values, one to its corresponding value in the space that
represents &#8220;condition $c$ true&#8221; and another to its corresponding value in the
space that represents &#8220;condition $c$ false&#8221;. It
is then safe to combine the two transitions. This is shown in the following
example.  Two intersecting patterns are unioned, one with a condition and one
without. The condition embedded in the first pattern does not affect the second
pattern.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>There are many more potential uses for semantic conditions. The user is free to
use arbitrary code and may therefore perform actions such as looking up names
in dictionaries, validating input using external parsing mechanisms or
performing checks on the semantic structure of input seen so far. In the next
section we describe how Ragel accommodates several common parser engineering
problems.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The semantic condition feature works only with alphabet types that are smaller
in width than the <code>long</code> type. To implement semantic conditions Ragel
needs to be able to allocate characters from the alphabet space. Ragel uses
these allocated characters to express "character C with condition P true" or "C
with P false." Since internally Ragel uses longs to store characters there is
no room left in the alphabet space unless an alphabet type smaller than long is
used.</p></div>

<h4 id="_condition_based_repetition">6.5.2. Condition Based Repetition</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>New in ragel 7 is a construct designed to simplify the use of conditions to
control repetition. While possible to count properly using condition embedding
operators, there is a corner case that proves difficult. If the zero-width case
is to be accepted properly, some knowledge of what is before and after is
necessary and tests need to be embedded there. The <code>:cond()</code> operator is
designed to solve this problem, automatically embedding actions such that a
zero count is possible.</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>:cond( &lt;expression&gt;,
        &lt;init&gt;, &lt;inc&gt;, &lt;min&gt; [ , &lt;max&gt; ] ):</code></pre>

<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
<code>expression</code> is the ragel-expression that is to be repeated.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<code>init</code> is an action that is used to initialize the state.
</p>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The <code>:cond</code> construct is a synonym for <code>:condstar</code>. Ragel also supports
<code>:condplus</code>, which does not allow the zero-width case. There must be at least

<h3 id="_nfa_features">6.6. NFA Features</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>New in Ragel 7 are features for specifying non-deterministic machines. Prior to
this, ragel always produced DFAs, so these features represent a departure
from the standard runtime model. They allow us to cope with very large state
machines, without having to compromise on the language matched, or devise some
techniques outside of the ragel language.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The NFA features require that the programmer make available <code>nfa_bp</code>, <code>nfa_len</code>
and <code>nfa_count</code> variables. See the section <a href="#variables_used_by_ragel">Varibles Used by Ragel</a></p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Note that NFA features are non compatible with non-contiguous buffer blocks. It
requires being able to set p to some previously stashed value. If the buffer is
no longer available, ragel will attempt to backtrack into invalid data.</p></div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_nfa_union">6.6.1. NFA Union</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The NFA union operator allows the programmer to create a large union of
expressions without making the construction fully deterministic. Only a prefix
is made deterministic, in a breadth-first manner, and up to a specified depth.</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>&lt;name&gt; |= ( &lt;depth&gt;, &lt;group-size&gt; ) &lt;expression1&gt; | &lt;expression2&gt; | ... ;</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The NFA union operator looks like a normal union, except some additional
controls are specified. The depth value says how deep into the machine the
NFA-to-DFA algorithm should go looking for NFA states to make deterministic.
The group-size value allows the programmer to set a limit on the number of
expressions that are packed into a single DFA prefix. If this value is zero,
there is no limit, and all expressions go into a single group. If this number
is less than the number of expressions, there will be an immediate NFA branch
for the groups, before entering into the DFA prefixes. Roughly speaking,
group-size allows you to control initial branch width.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>By making depth or groups-size smaller, you can shift cost from compile-time to
run-time to get otherwise intractable unions to build.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_nfa_repetition">6.6.2. NFA Repetition</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The NFA repetition construct <code>:nfa()</code> is designed to allow counting of objects
in an ambiguous context. While the <code>:cond()</code> construct is an efficent counting
method, it does not work properly when there are ambiguities around starting,
repeating, or exiting a repetition. Since condition tests are embedding into
transitions, they are made deterministic, therefore the repetition could be
simultaneously incrementing and exiting the repetition. In these cases the NFA
repetition is useful, because it will explore all possibilites and allow use
user to preserve and restore state. To pay for this, you must be willing to
accept backtracking, however, and also give up non-congiguous buffer blocks.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>While the NFA repetition construct is designed for counting, it is useful for
much more. It generalizes to a state capture/manipulation/test construct that
works regardless of ambiguities. For example, if there are two possible data
captures, the :nfa union operator can backtrack to try an alternate. It before
backtracking it can restore relevant state, then perform the new capture.</p></div>

</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<code>pop</code> is a condition action that restores state needed for counting instances
of expression. This is an expression due to a current limitation of the
implementation. In the future theis may change to a plain action.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<code>init</code> is an condition that is tested before entering the repeat.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<code>stay</code> is an condition that is tested before deciding to stay in the
expression, as opposed to wrapping around to begin a new expression, or
exiting. If true, this allows the expression to continue to match, once a final
state has been entered.

<div class="paragraph"><p>The following actions achieve a generalized repetition that looks for 10 to 100
repetitions of some expression. It requires that the count variable be placed

<h3 id="_implementing_lookahead">6.7. Implementing Lookahead</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>There are a few strategies for implementing lookahead in Ragel programs.
Leaving actions, which are described in <a href="#out_actions">Leaving Actions</a>, can be
used as a form of lookahead.  Ragel also provides the <code>fhold</code> directive
which can be used in actions to prevent the machine from advancing over the
current character. It is also possible to manually adjust the current character
position by shifting it backwards using <code>fexec</code>, however when this is
done, care must be taken not to overstep the beginning of the current buffer
block. In both the use of <code>fhold</code> and <code>fexec</code> the user must be
cautious of combining the resulting machine with another in such a way that the
transition on which the current position is adjusted is not combined with a
transition from the other machine.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_parsing_recursive_language_structures">6.8. Parsing Recursive Language Structures</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In general Ragel cannot handle recursive structures because the grammar is
interpreted as a regular language. However, depending on what needs to be
parsed it is sometimes practical to implement the recursive parts using manual
coding techniques. This often works in cases where the recursive structures are
simple and easy to recognize, such as in the balancing of parentheses.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>One approach to parsing recursive structures is to use actions that increment
and decrement counters or otherwise recognize the entry to and exit from
recursive structures and then jump to the appropriate machine defnition using
<code>fcall</code> and <code>fret</code>. Alternatively, semantic conditions can be used to
test counter variables.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>A more traditional approach is to call a separate parsing function (expressed
in the host language) when a recursive structure is entered, then later return
when the end is recognized.</p></div>
